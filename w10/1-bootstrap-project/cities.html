                        <p> Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. Its 3,748,148
                            (2018) inhabitants
                            make it the second most populous city proper of the European Union after London. The city is
                            one of Germany's 16 federal states. It is surrounded by the state of
                            Brandenburg, and contiguous with its capital, Potsdam. The two cities are at the center of
                            the
                            Berlin-Brandenburg capital region, which is, with about six million inhabitants and an area
                            of
                            more than 30,000 km², Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and
                            Rhine-Main regions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Berlin straddles the banks of the River Spree, which flows into the River Havel (a tributary
                            of
                            the River Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical
                            features
                            are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel, and
                            Dahme rivers (the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee). Due to its location in the European
                            Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city's
                            area
                            is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes. The city lies in the
                            Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian
                            dialects.</p>
                        <p>First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic
                            trade routes, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701),
                            the
                            Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic
                            (1919–1933),
                            and the Third Reich (1933–1945). Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in
                            the world. After World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the
                            city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave, surrounded by the
                            Berlin
                            Wall (1961–1989) and East German territory. East Berlin was declared capital of East
                            Germany,
                            while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin
                            once
                            again became the capital of all of Germany.</p>

                        <p> Hamburg officially the
                            Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg; German: Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg; Low German/Low
                            Saxon: Friee un Hansestadt Hamborg) is the second-largest city in Germany with a
                            population of over 1.8 million.
                        </p>
                        <p>One of Germany's 16 federal states, it is surrounded by Schleswig-Holstein to the north and
                            Lower Saxony to the south. The city's metropolitan region is home to more than five million
                            people. Hamburg lies on the River Elbe and two of its tributaries, the River Alster and the
                            River Bille.</p>
                        <p>The official name reflects Hamburg's history as a member of the medieval Hanseatic League and
                            a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. Before the 1871 Unification of Germany, it
                            was a fully sovereign city state, and before 1919 formed a civic republic headed
                            constitutionally by a class of hereditary grand burghers or Hanseaten. Beset by disasters
                            such as the Great Fire of Hamburg, North Sea flood of 1962 and military conflicts including
                            World War II bombing raids, the city has managed to recover and emerge wealthier after each
                            catastrophe.</p>
                        <p>
                            Hamburg is Europe's third-largest port. Major regional broadcasting firm NDR, the printing
                            and publishing firm Gruner + Jahr and the newspapers Der Spiegel and Die Zeit are based in
                            the city. Hamburg is the seat of Germany's oldest stock exchange and the world's oldest

                        <p>Munich
                            is the capital and most
                            populous city of Bavaria, the second most populous German federal state. With a population
                            of
                            around 1.5 million, it is the third-largest city in Germany, after Berlin and Hamburg, as
                            well as the 12th-largest city in the European Union. The city's metropolitan region is home
                            to 6
                            million people. Straddling the banks of the River Isar (a tributary of the Danube) north of
                            the Bavarian Alps, it is the seat of the Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria,
                            while
                            being the most densely populated municipality in Germany (4,500 people per km²). Munich is
                            the
                            second-largest city in the Bavarian dialect area, after the Austrian capital of Vienna.</p>
                        <p>The city is a global centre of art, science, technology, finance, publishing, culture,
                            innovation, education, business, and tourism and enjoys a very high standard and quality of
                            living, reaching first in Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey,
                            and being rated the world's most liveable city by the Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018.
                            According to the Globalization and World Rankings Research Institute Munich is considered an
                            alpha-world city, as of 2015. Munich is a major international center of engineering,
                            science,
                            innovation, and research, exemplified by the presence of two research universities, a
                            multitude
                            of scientific institutions in the city and its surroundings, and world class technology and
                            science museums like the Deutsches Museum and BMW Museum.. Munich houses many multinational
                            companies and its economy is based on high tech, automobiles, the service sector and
                            creative
                            industries, as well as IT, biotechnology, engineering and electronics among many others.</p>
                        <p> The name of the city is derived from the Old/Middle High German term Munichen, meaning "by
                            the
                            monks". It derives from the monks of the Benedictine order, who ran a monastery at the place
                            that was later to become the Old Town of Munich; hence the monk depicted on the city's coat
                            of
                            arms. Munich was first mentioned in 1158. Catholic Munich strongly resisted the Reformation
                            and
                            was a political point of divergence during the resulting Thirty Years' War, but remained
                            physically untouched despite an occupation by the Protestant Swedes. Once
                            Bavaria was established as a sovereign kingdom in 1806, it became a major European centre of
                            arts, architecture, culture and science. In 1918, during the German Revolution, the ruling
                            house
                            of Wittelsbach, which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and
                            a
                            short-lived socialist republic was declared.</p>

                        <p>Cologne is the largest city of Germany's most
                        populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and its 1 million+ (2016) inhabitants make it
                        the fourth most populous city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich. The largest city on
                        the Rhine, it is also the most populous city both of the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region, which
                        is Germany's largest and one of Europe's major metropolitan areas, and of the Rhineland. Centred
                        on the left bank of the Rhine, Cologne is about 45 kilometres (28 mi) southeast of North
                        Rhine-Westphalia's capital of Düsseldorf and 25 kilometres (16 mi) northwest of Bonn. It is the
                        largest city in the Central Franconian and Ripuarian dialect areas.</p>
                        <p>   The city's famous Cologne Cathedral (Kölner Dom) is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of
                        Cologne. There are many institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the
                        University of Cologne (Universität zu Köln), one of Europe's oldest and largest universities,
                        the Technical University of Cologne (Technische Hochschule Köln), Germany's largest university
                        of applied sciences, and the German Sport University Cologne (Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln),
                        Germany's only sport university. Cologne Bonn Airport (Flughafen Köln/Bonn) is Germany's
                        seventh-largest airport and lies in the southeast of the city. The main airport for the
                        Rhine-Ruhr region is Düsseldorf Airport.</p>
                        <p>Cologne was founded and established in Ubii territory in the 1st century AD as the Roman Colonia
                        Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, the first word of which is the origin of its name. An alternative
                        Latin name of the settlement is Augusta Ubiorum, after the Ubii. "Cologne", the French
                        version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. Cologne functioned as the
                        capital of the Roman province of Germania Inferior and as the headquarters of the Roman military
                        in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages the city flourished as
                        being located on one of the most important major trade routes between east and west in Europe.
                        Cologne was one of the leading members of the Hanseatic League and one of the largest cities
                        north of the Alps in medieval and Renaissance times. Prior to World War II the city had
                        undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918–1926). Cologne was one
                        of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, with the Royal Air Force (RAF)
                        dropping 34,711 long tons (35,268 tonnes) of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the
                        population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the
                        intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding
                        has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.</p>
